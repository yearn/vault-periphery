@notice
    This generic accountant is meant to serve as the accountant role
    for a Yearn V3 Vault. 
    https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults-v3/blob/master/contracts/VaultV3.vy

    It is designed to be able to be added to any number of vaults with any 
    underlying tokens. There is a default fee config that will be used for 
    any strategy that reports through a vault thats has been added to this
    accountant. But also gives the ability for the fee_manager to choose 
    custom values for any value for any given strategy they want to.

    Funds received from the vaults can either be distributed to a specified
    fee_recipient or redeemed for the underlying asset and held within this
    contract until distributed.
